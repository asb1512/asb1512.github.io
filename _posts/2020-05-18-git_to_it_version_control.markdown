Git, a type of version control, could be considered the of the most useful and influential inventions to the software design process, allowing many programmers to work on the same project without stepping on one another's toes.

Remember the days before Google Docs and Slides? Remember trying to work on the same college project with the rest of your group, only to find that your changes were overwritten or that you accidentally saved an older version? Now, imagine this same issue in a team of fifty or a hundred developers all working on thousands of lines of source code. You can see how this would quickly become unruly, if not impossible all together.

This is where Git comes in. Git "...is a distrubted version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development." and was invented by Linus Torvalds in 2005, also the creator of Linux.

The project began from the outset as a way for developers to collaborate on the Linux kernel development, but as time went on, it became clear that is technology had potential to completely alter the current software design process. Linus Torvalds, in typical fashion, kept the tech open-source, allowing for the maximum amount of collaboration, as well as making it accessible and available to the masses.

Now in 2020, thanks to the work of Mr. Torvalds, we have many options for open-source Git platforms. The most well known include *GitHub*, *SourceForge*, *Bitbucket*, and *GitLab*.
